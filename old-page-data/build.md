      Once you have decided on the layout and location, the Carn Kitchen
      installation starts with a shallow excavation in good ground conditions.
      150mm (6‚Äù) is the required depth and use of hardcore gravel is recommended
      to create a firm and level base. The steel base is laid in level, route
      your electric supply if required, and backfill the base with gravel to
      give a very secure footing for your assembly. The base is then re-instated
      to match the surroundings. This can be paving slabs, decking, gravel or
      simply re-lay the turf.


      Assembly of the components is then a simple task with two people and a socket drive.


      Think of your Carn Kitchen installation as a small building project, albeit a quick and easy one. We offer support and assistance in the assembly, so please discuss this so that we can work out logistics according to the geographical location.
